# Handpicked Books

## Made Using HTML, CSS and REACT.

Are you tired of searching for great books? If yes, then you are at the perfect place right now! I made this web-app that can recommend you a few books that I find amazing to read.

Handpicked books can let you navigate to your preffered genre of books through its super easy-to-follow **navigation bar**. All you need to do is just click on your preffered genre and it will show you the books you must read if you are a fan of that genre.

- **Navigation Bar**

After clicking your preffered genre, a **list of books** will appear. Each item from the list contains the name of the book, a brief description of the book, a rating given by me to the book, and a link that will redirect you to a page where you can find more information about the book and can purchase the book if you want.

You can either click on the **image** or the **_"know more"_** written just below the description of the book to get redirected to the linked pages.
